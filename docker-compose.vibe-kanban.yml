# Compose overrides to give Mordecai direct read/write access to Vibe-Kanban's persisted data directory.
# Usage:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.vibe-kanban.yml up -d

services:
  mordecai:
    # Run as host UID/GID to avoid creating root-owned files in bind mounts.
    user: "${HOST_UID:-1000}:${HOST_GID:-1000}"

    # Ensure HOME is writable when running as a numeric UID without an /etc/passwd entry.
    environment:
      HOME: /app/workspace

    # Mount Vibe-Kanban persistence at the exact same path used by the vibe-kanban container.
    volumes:
      - /home/ilia/.local/share/vibe-kanban:/home/ilia/.local/share/vibe-kanban:rw
